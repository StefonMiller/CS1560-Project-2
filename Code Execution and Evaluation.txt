I have included a screenshot of the results of my code execution on my machine with 8GB of RAM and an i5 processor.
From the screenshot, it can be seen that my script finishes executing just under the 5 minute mark at ~4 minutes and 58
seconds. The results of my script indicate that 'acow' appears in 3 web documents a total of 3 times. Those documents are 
lists-092-3952951, lists-092-4113429, and lists-108-11347927. It also indicates that 'yhoo' appeared in 5 text documents
(lists-023-10682161 - 3, lists-108-13957710 - 1, lists-108-14081562 - 1, lists-108-14193964 - 1, 
lists-108-14312844 - 1) a total of 7 times. I'm not sure if the code will finish in under 5 minutes on the test machine,
but it did on my own so I hope that will suffice for full credit. Additionally, I was able to fit my entire index structure
into RAM on my machine so I did not bother writing it to disk in chunks as it was mentioned in the instructions that this
is only necessary if you can't fit everything into memory.
