My scripts should be fairly easy to read as they are just small snippets of code under each of the supplied methods.
Each snippet of code is also commented for readability. To run my scripts, simply run the HW2Main.py file using
python HW2Main.py. The development environment I used was Python version 3.8.10 running on VSCode. Additionally, 
the 'data/indextext' and 'data/indexweb' should be initially empty as attempting to open them again leads to an error
since the files are so large.
